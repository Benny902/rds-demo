rds-demo

## demo to test the api of both monolith and microservice rds-app and benchmark comparison.


### to run the demo:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

 
both backends needs to be running:  
- run microservices backend with main branch - no changes needed.  
- run monolith backend with main-monolith branch with these changes:  
 on docker-compose.yml file:  
    - change port to 54402 ("54402:80")
    - comment out "depends on" in Reference.Data.Service
    - comment out cosmosEmulator and zipkin services to avoid conflict on docker
